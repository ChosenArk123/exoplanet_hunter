# Exoplanet Hunter

This project analyzes astronomy data to explore and detect patterns that may indicate the presence of exoplanets. Many planets outside our solar system have been found by observing small dips in a star’s light intensity over time. These dips can occur when a planet passes in front of its host star from our point of view, temporarily blocking some light — a method known as the *transit method* in exoplanet science. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Project Overview

This repository contains Python code and analysis notebooks that:

- Load and preprocess exoplanet time-series data from publicly available NASA datasets.
- Perform exploratory analysis to understand patterns in stellar brightness measurements.  
- Apply statistical or machine-learning techniques to classify or highlight candidate exoplanet signals.  
- Visualize light curves and model outputs to support interpretation and insight.

## Key Features

- Data ingestion and cleaning using `pandas`.  
- Time series feature extraction for identifying transit-like patterns.  
- Visualization of stellar flux measurements over time.  
- Optional use of supervised learning models to evaluate classification performance.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project comes from exoplanet catalogs and light-curve archives maintained by NASA’s Exoplanet Archive and related public repositories. These datasets include measurements of stellar brightness over time that researchers use to detect exoplanet transit signals. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies, for example:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
3. Run the notebooks in Jupyter or your preferred Python environment.

## Usage

Open the main analysis notebook to explore how data is processed.

Use the scripts and functions to load new data sets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.

Visualize light curves and test classification models on labeled exoplanet candidates.

## Results

Summaries and plots generated by this project help illustrate how dips in stellar brightness relate to possible exoplanet transits. Results include:

Light curves highlighting potential transit events.

Exploratory plots of flux variation over time.

Performance metrics for models that classify observations.

## Future Work

Future improvements could include:

Integrating additional datasets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.

Automating transit detection with more advanced machine learning models.

Comparing classification results using different feature sets.
